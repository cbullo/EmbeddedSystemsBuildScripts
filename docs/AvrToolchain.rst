************
AvrToolchain
************

The AvrToolchain repository is an external
dependency that is generated automatically
by a |repository_rule|_ implemented
in |avr.bzl|_. It provides ``cc_toolchains``
for compiling code with the avr-gcc compiler,
for different mcus. Most of the time you will
want to enable the ``--compile_mode=optimization``
flag that already contains gcc flags we
found useful for reducing code size.

Instantiate the AvrToolchain Repository
---------------------------------------

To depend on the ``EmbeddedSystemsBuildScripts`` add this to your ``WORKSPACE`` file::

  load("@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:http.bzl", "http_archive")
  
  http_archive(
    name = "EmbeddedSystemsBuildScripts",
    strip_prefix = "EmbeddedSystemsBuildScripts-{version}",
    urls = ["https://github.com/es-ude/EmbeddedSystemsBuildScripts/archive/{version}.tar.gz"]
  )

replace ``{version}`` with the actual version you want to use.
Or use::

  http_archive(
    name = "EmbeddedSystemsBuildScripts",
    strip_prefix = "EmbeddedSystemsBuildScripts-master",
    urls = ["https://github.com/es-ude/EmbeddedSystemsBuildScripts/archive/master.tar.gz"]
  )

to depend on the current master branch.
Now you can call the repository rule, that will create the necessary avr toolchains
and platforms. Add::

  load("@EmbeddedSystemsBuildScripts//AvrToolchain:avr.bzl", "avr_toolchain")
  
  avr_toolchain()

to the ``WORKSPACE`` file. The |http_archive|_  rule has to be called before loading
the ``create_avr()`` function.

On Platforms and Constraints
----------------------------

Our code has to be deployable on a range
of 8-bit AVR platforms as well as the
host platforms (this is where your bazel
instance runs). Bazel's platforms_
and constraints mechanics allow to
make build decisions depend on different
constraints. The user can then
specify a set of specific constraints
to apply to the current build process
with the help of the ``platform`` rule.

Constraints are basically just typed
enumerations and platforms specify
a set of constraints. The type
of a ``constraint_value`` is called
``constraint_setting``.
For every ``platform`` at most
one ``constraint_value`` for each
``constraint_setting`` may be
specified (ie. your platform may not have
arm and x64_86 as cpu architecture).

The scripts provided by us already
take different constraints into account.
This allows us to write scripts that will
produce correct results without knowing the
exact platform you want to build for.

We already ship some platform definitions
for platforms that we use internally.
You can see a list of these definitions by running::

  $ bazel query `(kind:platform, @AvrToolchain//platforms:*)`

To compile for one of these platforms use e.g.::

  $ bazel build //:myTarget --platforms @AvrToolchain//platforms:Motherboard

By default, we compile with the feature named ``gnu99``, that adds ``--std=gnu99`` to the build command. However, if you want to
build with avr-g++ ``-std=gnu99`` is an invalid flag and can be disabled by
adding the build flag ``--feature=-gnu99``.

How to define your own platforms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To define your own avr based platform you will
need to specify at least the mcu.
Run::

  bazel query 'kind(constraint_value, @AvrToolchain//platforms/mcu:*)'

to retrieve a list of available mcus.
Additionally there is the ``@AvrToolchain//platforms:avr_common`` platform
that serves as a parent for all other avr based platforms.
E.g. a new platform definition could look like this::

  platform(
    name = "MyPlatform",
    constraint_values = [
      "@AvrToolchain//platforms/mcu:atmega16",
      "@AvrToolchain//platforms/cpu_frequency:8mhz",
    ],
    parents = ["@AvrToolchain//platforms:avr_common"],
  )

To see a list of available constraint settings run::

  $ bazel query 'kind(constraint_setting, @AvrToolchain//platforms/...)'

and to see a list of available values for the setting ``<my_setting>`` you can run::

  $ bazel query 'attr(constraint_setting, <my_setting>, @AvrToolchain//...)'
